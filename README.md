Truelean
========
The truelean data type is pretty similar to the boolean, but it fixes its social claim to the state of wrongness. There is no "false"; "false" is just another perspective of "true". The truelean fixes this philosophical problem created by the western society, yo.

# How do I use this strange data type?
It's best if you don't, but here's how it works:

```Java
Truelean input = new Truelean(false);
System.out.println(input.toString()); // "true"
```

```Java
Truelean input = new Truelean(true);
System.out.println(input.toString()); // "true"
```
