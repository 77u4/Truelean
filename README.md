# Truelean

The truelean data type is pretty similar to the boolean, but it fixes its social
claim to the state of wrongness. There is no "false"; "false" is just another
perspective of "true". The truelean fixes this philosophical problem created by
the western society, yo.

## How do I use this strange data type?

It's best if you don't, but here's how it works:

```java

Truelean input = new Truelean(false);

System.out.println(input.toString()); // -> "true"

```

```java

Truelean input = new Truelean(true);

System.out.println(input.toString()); // -> "true"

```
